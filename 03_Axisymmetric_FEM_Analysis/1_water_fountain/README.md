# Material Properties

Concrete material properties used in the analysis: 

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Material | Concrete |
| Young’s Modulus | 29 GPa |
| Poisson Ratio | 0.15 |

---

# Fluid Properties

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Fluid Density | 1000 kg/m³ |
| Gravitational Acceleration | 9.81 m/s² |

---

# Theory of Hydrostatic Pressure

Hydrostatic pressure varies linearly with fluid depth.

The applied hydrostatic pressure is given by:

```math
P = \rho g h
```

Where:

- \( \rho \) = fluid density
- \( g \) = gravitational acceleration
- \( h \) = fluid depth

---

# Axisymmetric Formulation

The structure is modeled using a 2D axisymmetric formulation.

The geometry is revolved about the axis of symmetry internally by the solver.

This significantly reduces:

- computational cost
- number of elements
- solution time

while preserving 3D structural behavior.

# ANSYS Analysis

The analysis was performed using ANSYS Mechanical Static Structural.

---

# Analysis Type

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Analysis Type | Static Structural |
| Formulation | Axisymmetric |
| Solver | Direct Sparse |
| Large Deflection | OFF |

---

# Element Information

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Element Type | PLANE182 / PLANE183 |
| Formulation | 2D Axisymmetric Structural Element |

---

# Boundary Conditions

## Fixed Support

The bottom surface of the foundation was fully fixed.

---

## Axisymmetric Constraint

A frictionless support was applied along the axis of symmetry.

This constraint allows:

- axial displacement
- axisymmetric deformation

while restricting radial penetration across the symmetry axis.

---

## Hydrostatic Pressure

Hydrostatic pressure was applied on the top internal surface of the structure.

Pressure variation was automatically computed using:

- water density
- gravity
- fluid depth

---

# Mesh Information

A mapped mesh was used for accurate structured discretization.

## Mesh Controls

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Mesh Type | Mapped Face Mesh |
| Edge Sizing | 10 |
| Element Shape | Quadrilateral |
| Meshing Method | Face Meshing |

The mapped mesh provided:

- improved element quality
- smooth stress distribution
- better convergence behavior

# Results

---

# Directional Deformation

Directional deformation in the Y-direction was evaluated.

| Location | Deformation |
|---|---|
| Bottom Surface | 0.0 mm |
| Top Surface | -0.00496 mm |

The maximum deformation occurred at the upper free region of the structure.

---

# Equivalent Stress

Von Mises equivalent stress distribution showed:

- maximum stress concentration at the upper curved face
- smooth stress variation throughout the structure

Stress concentration occurred due to:

- geometric curvature
- hydrostatic pressure loading
- local stiffness variation

---

# Mesh Convergence Study

A convergence study was performed using adaptive mesh refinement.

## Convergence Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Convergence Quantity | Total Deformation |
| Allowable Change | 0.00005 |
| Maximum Refinement Loops | 8 |

The convergence study showed stable numerical behavior and good convergence.

The deformation solution became mesh independent after successive refinements.

---

# Validation

Validation of the model was performed using:

- mesh convergence study
- physical deformation behavior
- reaction consistency
- stress distribution assessment

The solution showed physically realistic structural response under hydrostatic loading.

---

# Key Observations

- Maximum deformation occurred near the free upper surface.
- The bottom fixed region remained fully constrained.
- Stress concentration developed at the curved upper corner.
- Axisymmetric modeling significantly reduced computational cost.
- Mapped mesh improved numerical stability and convergence.
